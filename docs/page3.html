    <h1> Introducing the Default Model</h1>
    As we said, the model in <b>SunRiZe</b> is changeable so we call
    the model : “<i>the default model</i>”.<br>
    <br>
    However the default model, that is vaguely inspired to <b>UML</b>
    but is <b>NOT UML</b>, it is a good starting point to design
    firmware and software for small devices efficiently.<br>
    <br>
    <h2> Modules</h2>
    <br>
    In the Main Context toolbar there are two symbols :<br>
    <br>
    <img src="k1.gif" alt="" width="90" hspace="100" height="43"><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    The first is the <b>Module</b> symbol, the second one is used to
    determine the <b>Dependencies</b> among modules.<br>
    <br>
    A <b>Module</b> is the basic unit in the model, and represents a
    “real” piece of code (in <b>C</b> language, two pieces of code, <b>.h</b>
    and <b>.c</b> ).<br>
    <br>
    In the <b>SunRiZe</b> graphics environment a <b>Module</b> is
    considered a “<i>Primary – Stand-Alone object</i>” that is an object
    that does not depends from other objects and can contain optionally
    a sub–context that is the <b>FSM</b>.<br>
    <br>
    From the point of view of the object oriented programming instead
    you can think to a <b>Module</b> as a unique static instance of a
    class with the own methods and attributes.<br>
    <br>
    To place a Stand-Alone object, select it from the <b>ToolBar</b>
    and place it freely into the drawing area, in this case the <i>Main
      Context</i> :<br>
    <br>
    <img src="k2.png" alt="" width="141" hspace="50" height="113"
      align="left">Part of the module code is auto-generated by the
    module and part must be edited with a simple editor (or an IDE)
    directly in the source files. <br>
    <br>
    When the code is regenerated, <b>SunRiZe</b> will take care to
    preserve certain pieces of code, using a <i>keywords based
      technique</i>.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Clicking twice on the module in the drawing area, we can open the <i>Module
      Editing Dialog Box</i> :<br>
    <br>
    <img src="dm.gif" alt="" width="458" hspace="50" height="323"
      align="left">This is a four tabs dialog box, which allows to
    describe the <b>Module </b>properties, and particularly :<br>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Attributes</li>
      <li>Operations</li>
      <li>Tokens </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Despite the basic code generator uses the <b>C</b> language that is
    not natively object oriented, <b>SunRiZe</b> implements some of the
    typical characteristics of the object oriented programming, as the <i>overloading</i>,
    the attributes/operations <i>visibility</i> and the presence of a <i>initializer</i>
    or constructor.<br>
    <br>
    The <b>Attributes</b> are implemented as global variables : the <i>Private

      Attributes</i> are defined “<b>static</b>” and the <i>Public
      Attributes</i> are referenced in the header file.<br>
    <br>
    We can find the same behavior for the <b>Operations</b> that are
    simple <b>C</b> functions working on the local variables in the
    modules (remember that all the instances are single).<br>
    <br>
    This kind of implementation does not impact on the functionality of
    the model, and at the same time avoid the usage of the data
    structures typical of the <b>C++</b> language and the related
    pointers and furthermore, it does not require any kind of dynamic
    allocation.<br>
    <br>
    The trans-module <i>overloading</i> property is introduced for
    Public Attributes and Operations, because they are always defined
    and linked as :<br>
    <br>
    <div class="code">
      <font color="#990000">&lt;Module Name&gt;</font>_<font
        color="#990000">&lt;Attribute / Operation Name&gt;</font></div>
    <br>
    <br>
    For example a public operation sum inside the module <i>Calc</i> is
    always referred as <i>Calc_sum ( )</i> that is similar to the
    object oriented call of <i>Calc.sum()</i>.<br>
    <br>
    The same function locally in the module where is defined, is then
    “aliased” as <i>sum( )</i>.<br>
    <br>
    The <b>Tokens</b> instead are not related to the object oriented
    programming but are inspired to the <i>Petri Net Transitions</i> .<br>
    <br>
    They are <i>global counters</i> which can be limited, raised and
    eventually enclosed in specific public operations and they are used
    to define a specific kind of transitions in the <b>Finite State
      Machine</b>.<br>
    <br>
    <h2> Modules Dependencies</h2>
    <br>
    In <b>SunRiZe</b> a dependency is defined as a “Junction” object,
    that requires the existence of two standalone (and compatible)
    objects to be placed in the drawn.<br>
    <br>
    After created two modules, you can select the symbol from in the <b>ToolBar</b>
    And place it <i>between</i> the <i>Source</i> and the <i>Destination</i>
    .<br>
    <img src="k3.png" alt="" width="404" hspace="50" height="246"
      align="left"><br>
    By placing the <b>Dependency</b>, we are saying that <b>Module</b>
    <i>depends from</i> <b>Required</b>.<br>
    <br>
    This connection has two immediate effects :<br>
    <ul>
      <li>The header file of Required is included into the body file of
        Module .</li>
      <li>The initialization order of the modules can change.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    The initialization order of the modules tries to follow the
    dependencies schema so that <i>Required</i> will be initialized
    before <i>Module</i>.<br>
    This order that is determined by a <b>DSF</b> algorithm, obviously
    fails for modules connected by <i>cyclic dependencies</i>.<br>
    <br>
    <h2><b> </b>Finite State Machine</h2>
    <b> </b><br>
    With <b>SunRiZe</b> we can create three types of modules :<br>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Free code without an initializer, that are usually used as
        libraries or independent pieces of code.</li>
      <li>Module with an initializer, used to define real objects, for
        example a specific timer o serial port which must be
        initialized.</li>
      <li>The Finite State Machines , used to implements the algorithmic
        parts running in non-preemptive multitasking.</li>
    </ul>
    In this chapter we discuss the features and the behavior of the <b>Finite
      State Machines</b>.<br>
    <br>
    Each Module can include a single <b>Finite State Machine</b>
    (briefly FSM) that is implemented by several attributes and a run
    function.<br>
    <br>
    To insert a <b>FSM</b> into a Module , we need to keeping selected
    the module and then press <b>Ins</b> .<br>
    <br>
    This command creates/changes the drawing area to the module local
    context that is the <b>FSM</b>.<br>
    <br>
    The <b>Tool-bar</b> also changes to the <b>FSM</b> toolbar :<br>
    <br>
    <img src="k4.gif" alt="" width="134" hspace="100" height="48"><br>
    <br>
    Showing the objects that can be placed in the <b>FSM</b> context
    that are respectively :<br>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li><b>States</b></li>
      <li> <b>Transitions</b></li>
      <li><b>Branches</b></li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    There is another object that is the <b>Initial State</b> which
    can’t be placed because it is unique, non-removable and already
    present in the drawing as a big black spot.<br>
    <br>
    We can build the <b>FSM</b> starting from this point.<br>
    <br>
    <h2> States and Transitions</h2>
    <br>
    A <b>Finite State Machine</b> is essentially composed by <b>States</b>
    and <b>Transitions</b>.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <img src="k5.gif" alt="" width="91" hspace="100" height="66"
      align="left"><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    The <b>States</b> are <i>Standalone Objects</i> and can be freely
    placed and moved on the drawing area.<br>
    <br>
    A machine can <i>jump</i> from a state to another when some kind of
    <b>Event</b> happens, this is done by placing a <i>junction</i>
    between states of type <b>Transition</b> :<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <img src="k6.gif" alt="" width="249" hspace="50" height="89"
      align="left"><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    In <b>SunRize</b> we have 3 types of <b>Events</b> :<br>
    <br>
    <h3>Conditions</h3>
    <img src="c1.gif" alt="" width="139" hspace="50" height="45"
      align="left"><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    The transition shots when a particular condition is detected. A
    condition is a counter-less situation that is always considered.<br>
    <br>
    <h3> Timers</h3>
    <img src="c2.gif" alt="" width="122" hspace="50" height="57"><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    The transition shots after a certain amount of time from the
    previous transition.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3> Tokens</h3>
    <img src="c3.gif" alt="" width="121" hspace="50" height="57"><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    The transition shots when someone, somewhere , raises the token or
    calls a proper module method which does the same thing.<br>
    <br>
    <h3>Shooting<br>
    </h3>
    <br>
    When a transition <i>shots</i>, three blocks of codes are executed
    in this order :<br>
    <br>
    <img src="c4.png" alt="" width="475" hspace="50" height="139"><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <img src="ds.gif" alt="" width="368" hspace="50" height="212"
      align="right">These blocks of code are related to the two <i>states</i>
    and the <i>transition</i>, we can set them by opening with a double
    click the <i>State Editing Dialog Box</i> :<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    And the <i>Transition Editing Dialog Box</i> :<img src="dt.gif"
      alt="" width="368" hspace="50" height="212" align="right"><br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    In these dialog boxes we can also recognize a couple of elements
    that are :<br>
    <br>
    The <b>Do Action</b> associated to the state that is executed
    continuously in an open loop while the system is remaining in that
    states.<br>
    <br>
    The <b>Guard Condition</b> that is strictly related to the Token
    event and blocks the execution of a transition if the guard is not
    satisfied.<br>
    <br>
    <h2> </h2>
    <h2> Branches</h2>
    <img src="k7.gif" alt="" width="297" hspace="50" height="179"
      align="left"><br>
    A <b>Branch</b> is used to change the destination of a transition
    upon a specific condition.<br>
    <br>
    In this case for example, after 200ms the transition shots but the
    destination is State2 only if i==3 , if i!=3 the default <i>branch</i>
    (without a condition) creates an <i>auto-loop</i> on State1.<br>
    <br>
