    <h1>Branches and conditions</h1>
    <h2>Night and Day<br>
    </h2>

    <br>
    This is the traffic semaphore we have previously defined in the
    module <b>Semaphore</b> .<br>
    <br>
    Now we will introduce a <i>Night/Day</i> switch that is an external<i>
      timer </i>with a contact, <b>NO</b>/day and <b>NC</b>/night.<br>
    <br>
    We will connect this timer between the pull-up input we set for the
    <b>port 7</b> of the <i>Arduino</i> hardware, that is the <b>PORTD
      6</b>.<br>
    <br>
    During the night the original state of the <b>Semaphore</b> is
    suspended, and the <b>yellow light</b><b>s</b> flash on both side
    to indicate a potentially dangerous situation.<br>
    <br>

      align="left">We can do that by introducing two more states <b>YFlashOff</b>
    and <b>YFlashOn</b> .<br>
    <br>
    In <b>YFlashOff </b>all the lights are switched off :<br>

Now the problem is to connect the new piece of machine to the old one with an <b>entering transition</b> and an <b>exiting transition</b>.<br></p><p>We will act between the <b>GDir </b>and <b>YDir</b> by removing the transition and replacing it with a <b>Branch</b> :<img src="dd4.png" alt="" width="32" hspace="20" height="32" align="middle"><br></p><div class="reference"><b>Note :</b> to remove the transition as well as each
  other object in a context, you have to keep selected it pressing the
  <i>left mouse key</i> and at the same time, pressing <b>Del</b><span style="font-weight: normal">.</span></div><br>The <b>Branch </b>is a standalone object (not primary) which changes the logic of the code generation, by introducing conditions<i>.<br></i><img src="dd3.png" alt="" width="172" hspace="50" height="131" align="left"><p>After we have placed the <b>Branch</b> (that does not have properties) , we can complete everything by adding an entry transitions, timed as the previous one and with the same parameters, from <b>GDir</b> to the <b>Branch</b>.&nbsp; <br></p><p>The conditions stay in the exiting transitions from the <b>Branch</b> to the destinations.<br></p><p><br></p>In this case, we can place two different exiting transitions from the <b>Branch</b> : the first one to <b>YDir</b> and the second one to <b>YFlashOn</b> .<br><br>A double click on the <b>Transition</b> connecting the <b>Branch&nbsp; </b>to the <b>YFlashOn</b> , and the related <i>Editing Dialog Box</i> will open :<br><br><img src="dd5.png" alt="" width="418" hspace="50" height="244" align="left">This dialog tell us that transitions exiting from a branch,&nbsp; <b>are not real transition</b><b>s</b> because they do not have a trigger. In facts, the trigger, but are executed under a <i>Guard Condition</i> which means, if and only if the condition is satisfied. In this case we place this condition :<br><br><b>! (PIND&amp;0x40)<br><br></b>That means only if the <b>PIND 6 BIT is 0</b> that means that the pull-up is forced to ground by the external clock.<br><br>The <i>Transition</i> connecting the <b>Branch </b>to the <b>YDir</b> can be leaved <i>empty</i> , in this case it will be the <i>default transition</i> acting only if no other conditions are satisfied in any way.<br><br><br><br><br><div class="reference">A <b>Branch</b> is a cross-point which can have <b>more</b>
entering lines and <b>one</b> or <b>more</b> exiting line.<br>
<p>The <b>entry line</b><b>s</b> are regular <b>Transitions</b> shot
  by some kind of event and coming also from different states. The <b>exiting
    lines</b>, are not regular transitions, you can call it <i>Branches
  </i>if you want, because they have not a connected event, but only
  different <b>correlated or uncorrelated </b>conditions that brings
  to different States.<br>
  <br>
  This <b>conditions</b> are expressed by setting the field <i>Guard
    Condition</i>. If an <b>exiting line</b> has <b>no condition</b>,
  it is called <b>default or else</b>, and it is executed only if all
  the other conditions fail.<br>
  <br>
  Both, the <b>entering Transitions</b> and the <b>exiting Branches</b>
  can have an associated <b>Action</b>, in this case <b>Transitions</b>,
  are executed immediately when the event happens, while the winning <b>Branch</b>
  is executed only if its condition is true.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Note:</b> You can have several conditioned and only one default
  condition, but if the conditions are uncorrelated the result is
  unpredictable, because only the first branch meeting the right
  condition is traveled. In this case you need to modify the model and
  create a <i>Cascade of Conditions</i> to be sure your result is
  determinable.</p></div>An interesting effect of putting the code directly into the <i>Entry Action</i> of the states, instead of the <i>Transition</i> is that the code indicated in <b>YFlashOn</b> will be <i>repeated</i> and the yellow lights will be switched on immediately after the <b>GDir</b> time has gone, as well as in the returning transitions from <b>YFlashOff</b> .<br><br><br><br><img src="dd6.png" alt="" width="495" hspace="50" height="396" align="left">Now that we have the entering situation we can define an exit situation and in this case we will use a <i>shortcut</i>.<br><br>In facts , by definition, a <i>Timed Transition</i> works as <i>Timeout</i> . If this <i>Timeout</i> is undetermined or too short, is better to use a branch to be sure that the things are done in the right order. If the timeout is relatively <i>long</i> you can parallelize the exiting transition from a state with a <i>Conditioned Transition </i>or <i>Token Transition</i> too. <br><br>Usually the normal use of the <i>Timed Transitions</i> is just to be used as a timeout for other events to bring the system in a stable and safe state, if the event does not occur.<br><br>If we use the exiting transition from <b>YFlashOff</b> as timeout we can introduce a new<i> </i><b>Conditioned Transition</b><i> .</i><br><br><br>

<p><br><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>We can connect <b>YFlashOff</b> directly to <b>GCross</b> with a transition and use the related dialog box to compile this condition :<br></p><img src="dd7.png" alt="" width="456" hspace="50" height="266" align="left"><p><br>Note that in the other part of the model, we placed the code directly on the transition, so the code is never replicated automatically and must be defined for each<i> transition</i>.<br></p><p>The condition is the opposite of the previous one it <i>shots</i> immediately when in the state <b>YFlashOff </b>detects that the timer opens, or at most two seconds after if it is too late.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<p>
</p><div class="reference">
<b>Note: </b>the main difference between this method and the <b>Branch</b>
  placed above, is that the the <b>Branch</b> works only <i>at the
    moment the main transition</i> <i>shots</i>, while the <b>Conditioned
    Transition</b> works for the whole time the machine remains in <b>YFlashOff</b>.</div><br>The resulting model is :<br><br><img src="dd8.png" alt="" width="452" hspace="50" height="362"><br><br><br>
And now you can <b>Generate the Code</b> , <i>upload it </i>on <i>Arduino</i>
but before running it, you can simulate the external timed switch with a
simple wire wrapped to the pin 7 of the <i>Arduino </i>connector to
the <i>Ground</i>.<br><br>
<br>
<img src="dd9.png" alt="" width="354" hspace="40" height="304" align="left"> <i>When the wire is connected to the ground, after the Green on Main Direction the semaphore begins to flash, until the wire is removed.</i><br>
<br>
<br>
Obviously you are strongly encouraged to take a look at the generated
code, to better understand as the branches are managed by <b>SunRiZe</b>.<br>
