<h1 class="western">What is SunRiZe</h1>
<p class="western"><b>SunRiZe</b> is an open and simplified
Model-Driven Development software, specifically oriented to the
design of microcontrollers firmware/software.</p>
<p class="western">A Model-Driven Development software (or MDD) is a
programmers tool that is able to generate a relevant part of source
code, starting from one or more drawings representing the “model”.
</p>
<p class="western">Usually a MDD is used to create object oriented
source code, in C++ or Java programming languages, starting by UML
diagrams.</p>
<p class="western"><b>SunRiZe</b> , uses a different strategy, based
on three levels :</p>
<ul>
	<li/>
<p class="western">The graphics editor</p>
	<li/>
<p class="western">The model</p>
	<li/>
<p class="western">The code generator</p>
</ul>
<p class="western">That are logically separated, and where only the
graphics editor is a fixed part, while the model is easily modifiable
and extensible and the code generator is javascript.</p>
<p class="western">In these pages we will describe the standard
<b>SunRiZe</b> with the default model that has been designed to
create microcontrollers software in C language. 
</p>
<h2 class="western">SunRiZe Design</h2>
<p class="western"><b>SunRiZe</b> has been developed by following a
strong object oriented philosophy in which there is a drawing space,
that is able to contains <i>Standalone</i><span style="font-variant: normal">
</span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">objects
and </span></span><i>Connections</i><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">,
each of ones with a proper editing dialog and a generic content, that
is a dynamic polymorphic variable.</span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">The
entire content of the drawn can be converted to a </span></span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal"><b>JSON</b></span></span><span style="font-variant: normal">
</span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">text
file that can be saved or passed to an integrated javascript engine,
enhanced with specific functions, expressly designed to produce code.</span></span></p>
<p class="western" style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">From
this point of view both the model and the language are completely
open to modifications and free implementation, of new objects and
scripts.</p>
<p class="western">You will find further documentation into the code
that is completely commented with <i>Doxygen compliant comments.</i></p>
<p class="western">In this document we will analyze the current model
that is simplified, with a generator designed to produce <b>C-89</b>
compatible code for micro controllers, even without operating system
like the <i>Arduino</i> system for example.</p>
<p class="western">Is not so difficult to change the code generator
script, to generate code in other languages, as for example the PIC
assembler, by changing ecma <i>script.</i></p>
<p class="western">Changing the model instead is a bit more
difficult, and requires to study and change the <b>SunRiZe</b> code
that is written in <i>C++-1x</i>.</p>
<h2 class="western" style="margin-right: 3cm">Why GPL v.3.0</h2>
<p class="western"><span style="font-weight: normal">I chose the GPL
license, because</span> <b>SunRiZe</b> is designed to be changed and
adapted to other models, and YOU must be free to make this project
grows.</p>
<p class="western">Anyway, GPL v.3.0 does not concern the code
produced with <b>SunRiZe</b>, as well as the gcc compiler does not
concern the code compiled with the compiler.</p>
<p class="western">GPL v.3.0 requires only that if you make any kind
of changes to this software you have to release it under the same
license that is open and free, that is an acceptable limitation for
the purposes of this project.</p>
<p class="western"><b>SunRiZe</b>, freely includes the sources code
from the <a href="http://duktape.org/"><b>duktape</b></a><a href="http://duktape.org/">
javascript engine</a> that is released under the terms of the MIT
license.</p>
