    <h1> What is SunRiZe</h1>
    <b><br>
    </b><b> SunRiZe </b>is an open and simplified <i>Model-Driven
      Development software</i>, specifically oriented to the design of
    microcontrollers firmware/software.<br>
    <br>
    A Model-Driven Development software (or MDD) is a programmers tool
    that is able to generate a relevant part of source code, starting
    from one or more drawings representing the “model”.<br>
    <br>
    Usually a MDD is used to create object oriented source code, in C++
    or Java programming languages, starting by UML diagrams.<br>
    <br>
    <b> SunRiZe </b>, uses a different strategy, based on three levels
    :<br>
    <ul>
      <li>The graphics editor</li>
      <li>The model</li>
      <li>The code generator</li>
    </ul>
    That are logically separated, and where only the graphics editor is
    a fixed part, while the model is easily modifiable and extensible
    and the code generator is javascript.<br>
    <br>
    In these pages we will describe the standard <b>SunRiZe</b> with
    the default model that has been designed to create microcontrollers
    software in C language.<b><br>
    </b><br>
    <h2>SunRiZe Design</h2>
    <b>SunRiZe</b> has been developed following a strong object oriented
    philosophy in which there is a drawing space, that is able to
    contains Standalone objects and Connections, each of ones with a
    proper editing dialog and a generic content, that is a dynamic
    polymorphic variable.<br>
    <br>
    The entire content of the drawn can be converted to a JSON text file
    that can be saved or passed to an integrated <i>javascript engine</i>,
    enhanced with specific functions, expressly designed to produce
    code.<br>
    <br>
    From this point of view both the model and the language are
    completely open to modifications and free implementation, of new
    objects and scripts.<br>
    <br>
    You will find further documentation into the code that is completely
    commented with <i>Doxygen</i> compliant comments.<br>
    <br>
    In this document we will analyze the current model that is
    simplified, with a generator designed to produce <b>C-99</b>
    compatible code for micro controllers, even without operating system
    like the <i>Arduino</i> system for example.<br>
    <br>
    Is not so difficult to change the code generator script, to generate
    code in other languages, as for example the <i>PIC assembler</i>,
    by changing the javascript.<br>
    <br>
    Changing the model instead is a bit more difficult, and requires to
    study and change the <b>SunRiZe</b> code that is written in <b>C++-1x</b>.<br>
    <br>
    <h2>Why GPL v.3.0</h2>
    I chose the <b>GPL</b> license, because <b>SunRiZe</b> is designed
    to be changed and adapted to other models, and <b>YOU</b> must be
    free to make this project grows.<br>
    <br>
    Anyway, <b>GPL v.3.0</b> does not concern the code produced with <b>SunRiZe</b>,
    as well as the <b>gcc</b> compiler does not concern the code
    compiled with the compiler.<br>
    <br>
    <b> GPL v.3.0</b> requires only that if you make any kind of changes
    to this software you have to release it under the same license that
    is open and free, that is an acceptable limitation for the purposes
    of this project.<br>
    <br>
    <b> SunRiZe</b>, freely includes the sources code from the <a
      href="http://duktape.org/"><i><b>duktape javascript</b></i></a>
    engine that is released under the terms of the MIT license.<br>
