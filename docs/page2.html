    <h1> First steps with SunRiZe</h1>
    <h2> Projects</h2>
    A project is composed by a single model file (that is a json file)
    and several source files, that are the compilable code.<br>
    <br>
    From the model file we can create and modify the related source
    files but those file are modifiable and parts of the written code
    can be stored in the source files only, so it is not possible to
    consider a project file, without the generated source files.<br>
    <br>
    However if you do not need to change the project model after
    released, you can avoid to copy the model file and the project will
    be considered completely independent from <b>SunRiZe</b>.<br>
    <br>
    The parts of code generated by the “model” are completely manageable
    by the <b>SunRiZe</b> graphics editor an contained in several
    drawings called<b> contexts</b>.<br>
    <br>
    In the current version of <b>SunRiZe</b>, these drawings can be
    ordered in a two level tree, with a main context describing the
    generic structure of the project, and several sub-contexts,
    describing the related<b> FSM</b>s ( finite state machines ).<br>
    <br>
    <h3>Creating a project-space</h3>
    Due to the fact that a project-space is strongly connected to the
    IDE or the editor we are using, and many editors create it
    automatically, the creation of a project-space is an operation that
    must be performed manually.<br>
    <br>
    <b>SunRiZe</b>, considers a project space as a folder where it can
    put the model and the code. The <i>C generator</i>, generates the
    code in two sub-folders called <b>include</b> for the include files
    and <b>src</b> for the source files.<br>
    <br>
    Several IDEs do not allow to set the name of this sub-folders or use
    different names : in these cases, you can resolve everything with
    some link. For example with the <i>Arduino </i>ide, that uses a
    single folder to store everything, you can create a root folder with
    the name of the project, and a sub-folder named <i>Arduino</i>
    inside the root folder, then a couple of links <b>src</b> and <b>include</b>
    to the <i>Arduino</i> folder.<br>
    <br>
    The links can be created in this way :<br>
    <br>
    For POSIX systems (always into the Semaphore folder) :<br>
    <br>
    <div class="code"> <br>
      ln -s Arduino src<br>
      ln -s Arduino include<br>
      <br>
    </div>
    <br>
    for Windows:<br>
    <div class="code"> <br>
      mklink /J src Arduino<br>
      mklink /J include Arduino<br>
      <br>
    </div>
    <br>
    The result is something like this :<br>
    <div class="code"> <br>
      MyProject<br>
      |<br>
      + Arduino<br>
      + src → Arduino<br>
      + include → Arduino<br>
      <br>
    </div>
    <br>
    <br>
    At this point you can use the folder <b>MyProject</b> as a <b>SunRiZe</b>
    project folder (and the model will be placed in this folder), and
    you will find all your generated code in the Arduino folder where
    you will be able to put the<b> .ino</b> main file also and use it to
    compile the project.<br>
    <br>
    This procedure can be easily adapted to different situations.<br>
    <br>
    <h3> Standard Files</h3>
    <br>
    Before compiling the code, we need to copy four files, that can be
    modified to be adapted to the current development environment and
    CPU.<br>
    <br>
    These files deserve a special chapter later in this document, but we
    need to consider that the inclusion has to be considered a part of
    the project setup.<br>
    <br>
    <h2>Layout</h2>
    <br>
    The <b>SunRiZe</b> layout is composed by four different areas.<br>
    <br>
    <img src="l3.png" alt="" width="571" hspace="50" height="391"><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    The <i>Project View</i> is the navigation bar indicating the
    current context. Originally a project has an empty main context
    only.<br>
    <br>
    The<i> Drawing Space</i>, likewise a normal editor, is the
    viewing/editing area for the selected context. We will see how to
    draw and modify the items in this area later in this document.<br>
    <br>
    The <i>Current Toolbar</i> is the tool-bar we will need to
    introduce new items in our drawings, and it depends from the context
    type. Due to the fact the we have two different context types , a
    main context and a FSM context we have two different toolbars.<br>
    <br>
    At the beginning&nbsp; the tool-bar that is of type main, is grayed
    because we have not yet defined the project.<br>
    <br>
    In the Main Menu we can see :<br>
    <br>
    <b>File</b><b><br>
    </b>&nbsp; Reload<br>
    &nbsp; Save<br>
    <b>&nbsp; Project</b><b><br>
    </b><b>&nbsp; Exit</b><b><br>
    </b><b> </b><br>
    <b>Generate</b><b><br>
    </b>&nbsp; Generate Code<br>
    <br>
    <b>Help</b><br>
    &nbsp;<b>About</b><br>
    <br>
    All disabled except for <i>About</i>, <i>Exit</i> and <i>Project</i>.<br>
    <br>
    With <i>Project</i>, we can choose a folder (in the previous
    example <b>MyProject</b>) and the model will become editable.<br>
    <br>
    With <b>Save</b> we can save the current model that is unique in
    the current folder and always named <b>model.srz </b>.<br>
    <br>
    If a file model named <b>model.srz</b> is already present into the
    folder the model will be opened instead of created and will allows
    to edit the model.<br>
