    <h1>Module Design</h1>
    <br>
    To create a module, press on the module symbol in the <b>Tool-Bar</b>
    and then click on the panel in the right side.<br>
    <br>
    <img src="bb1.png" alt="" width="32" hspace="50" height="32"
      align="left"><img src="bb2.png" alt="" width="481" height="310"><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    We have to build a semaphore, so we can reasonably change the name
    of the module, from <i>Module</i> to <b>Semaphore</b> . To do this
    we need to open the <i>module editing dialog box</i>.<br>
    <br>
    <img src="bb3.png" alt="" width="476" hspace="50" height="335"
      align="left">Here we have 4 tabs that are used in the developing
    process, we are working on the first one, that includes the name and
    the generic comment that could be <i>doxygen</i> compliant.<br>
    <br>
    The first thing a program does, when it starts to run, is to
    initialize the instances by invoking the constructors.<br>
    <br>
    Our constructor is called <b>Init</b> function and it is invoked
    inside a unique function that must be called before the firmware
    main loop.<br>
    <br>
    If a module has a proper static machine it must have a <b>Init</b>
    that is used to set the initial state, the internal timer and
    eventually many other things.<br>
    <br>
    Even if the module does not have a static machine, a constructor can
    be useful, so it is always generated by default. If you really do
    not like it, you can un-flag the proper checkbox, and the module
    will not be involved in the initialization process.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    The simplified design of a semaphore ( for a perfect world ) ,
    should be a loop though a sequence of four states:<br>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li><img src="bb5.png" alt="" width="28" hspace="30" height="17"
          align="left"><b>R</b>ed on the <b>D</b>irect way, <b>Y</b>ellow

        on the <b>C</b>rossing way</li>
      <li> <img src="bb6.png" alt="" width="28" hspace="30" height="17"
          align="left"><b>G</b>reen on the Direct way, <b>R</b>ed on
        the <b>C</b>rossing way</li>
      <li><img src="bb4.png" alt="" width="28" hspace="30" height="17"
          align="left"><b>Y</b>ellow on the Direct way, <b>R</b>ed on
        the <b>C</b>rossing way</li>
      <li><img src="bb7.png" alt="" width="28" hspace="30" height="17"
          align="left"><b>R</b>ed on the Direct way, <b>G</b>reen on
        the <b>C</b>rossing way</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    A traffic semaphore works with <i>timers</i>, we need four timers,
    each of one representing the time to the next state: we store the
    time values as public attributes, that can be eventually modified by
    other modules, respectively : <b>timeYC</b> , <b>timeGD</b> , <b>timeYD</b>
    and <b>timeGC</b>.<br>
    <br>
    We can place these values into the <b>Attributes</b> tab with a
    default value, using the <b>New</b> button to apply a new
    attribute, and compile the fields :<br>
    <br>
    <img src="bb10.png" alt="" width="328" hspace="50" height="232"
      align="left">We are defining a <b>Public</b> attribute of type <i>long</i>,
    that is the standard type for the time delay and must be the signed
    version of the absolute time variable.<br>
    <br>
    In the case of <i>Arduino</i>, this variable is an unsigned long
    returned by <i>millis()</i>. We use the two complements arithmetic
    to resolve the overflow problem.<br>
    <br>
    The flag Interrupt Safe declares this variable as volatile, but if
    we do not need to set or use this variables from an interrupt we do
    not care of it.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    The <i>public attribute</i> is defined and exported to the other
    modules as <b>Semaphore_timeYC </b>, whereas in the <i>module
      body</i> is redefined as <b>timeYC</b>.<br>
    <pre class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.5cm; background: #ffffff"><font color="#800000"><b>extern</b></font><font color="#000000"> </font><font color="#800000"><b>long</b></font><font color="#000000"> Semaphore_timeYC</font><font color="#800080">;</font></pre>
    As well as we have defined <b>timeYC</b>, we can define the
    remaining timers, <b>timeGD</b> (60000 ms), <b>timeYD</b> (5000
    ms), <b>timeGC </b>(45000ms) :<br>
    <br>
    <img src="bb11.png" alt="" width="389" hspace="30" height="275"
      align="left"><br>
    and then close the dialog box.<br>
    <br>
    <img src="bb12.png" alt="" width="83" hspace="20" height="110"><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    At this point we can <b>File→Save</b> the model.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <div class="reference"> The file <i>model.srz</i> contains the
      model and eventually a part of the code, but not the whole code
      that in safe in the associated C files into the related code
      blocks.<br>
      <br>
      Anyway, this model represents your work and should be preserved
      with your preferred version control, because it is a simple <i>JSON</i>
      file.<br>
      <br>
      Note: <i>JSON</i> is simple to manage with <i>GIT</i> or <i>SVN</i>
      and this is not a coincidence: you are free to think a future with
      a centralized web accessible code storage and generation if you
      want. </div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h1>Welcome to the machine</h1>
    <h2> Ins</h2>
    <br>
    After defined the properties of the module, we have to explain<i>
      what it has to do</i>.<br>
    <br>
    To do this, we can describe the features of our semaphore with a <i>Finite

      State Machine</i>.<br>
    <br>
    We can select the <b>Module </b>object by keeping the
    left-mouse-button pressed and the press “<b>Ins</b>” on the
    keyboard:<br>
    <br>
    <h2>FSM design</h2>
    Something has changed.<br>
    <br>
    <img src="bb13.png" alt="" width="368" hspace="10" height="261"
      align="left"><br>
    In the left bar you can see another context called <b>Semaphore</b>
    (that is the name of the module) the Toolbar is different and in the
    drawing, there is a new context with a black spot.<br>
    <br>
    <div class="reference"> The black spot is movable but not removable,
      it is called <b>Init State</b> and it is the starting point for
      the machine associated to the module.<br>
      <br>
      Then we can navigate among the contexts by selecting them from the
      list.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b> Note: </b>we said that a graphic object can be <i>Standalone</i>
      or a <i>Junction</i> but this is an incomplete information
      because we have the <b>Primary</b> objects too. A Primary object
      is derived from the Standalone prototype, but has the capability
      to contain one new Context that in the model and in the JSON
      structure, become a new array of objects</div>
    <br>
    <h2><br>
    </h2>
    <h2>States<br>
    </h2>
    Select the <b>State</b> symbol in the <b>Tool-Bar</b><img
      src="bb14.png" alt=""
      width="32" hspace="40" height="32"> <br>
    <br>
    and click into the new created context :<br>
    <img src="bb15.png" alt="" width="253" hspace="30" height="186"
      align="left"><br>
    We have introduced the first State. <br>
    <br>
    A state has a name and several properties, we can start by changing
    the name to <b>YCross</b>&nbsp; (<b>Red</b> on <b>Direct)</b> and
    to do this we need to open the <i>State Editing Dialog Box.</i><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <img src="bb16.png"
      alt="" width="303" hspace="30" height="235" align="left"><br>
    In addition to the name change, we have three fields that can be
    filled directly with code and are stored in the model file.<br>
    <br>
    This code will be executed directly in a switch/case statement, it
    should be short and without variable declarations, it is related to
    the <i>Entry Action, </i>the <i>Exit Action</i> and the <i>DoAction</i>
    that is executed continuously while the system remains in that
    state.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <div class="reference">
      <b>Note:</b> You cannot define a variable in that block unless you
      define a
      code block by writing everything between braces { } , but this is
      not a
      good solution.<br>
      <br>
      The safest way is to define a private operation in the module and
      call
      it with a line of code.
    </div>
    <br>
    <h2>Transitions</h2>
    <h3>The Init Transition</h3>
    If we have two states we can connect them by a <b>Transition</b> .<br>
    <br>
    The <b>Init State </b>also can be connected with a transition, but
    it is an anomalous transition, without a trigger and with the code
    executed directly in the<b> </b><i>constructor</i> of the module.<br>
    <br>
    To place a <i>Transition</i> we can start choosing this symbol from
    the <b>Tool-Bar&nbsp;<img src="bb18.png" alt="" width="32"
        height="32" align="middle"></b> <br>
    And placing into the drawing space by clicking on the <i>Init State</i>
    before and then to the <i>YCross</i><i>.</i><br>
    <br>
    <img src="bb17.png" alt="" width="254" hspace="50" height="156"
      align="left">In this transition we can set the state machine and
    initialize the hardware to properly run the code, this code is :<br>
    <pre class="western" style="text-align: left"><font color="#696969"><i>/* Bit X X GD YD RD GC YC RC */</i></font>
<font color="#000000">DDRD<font color="#808030">=</font>B00111111<font color="#800080">;</font></font>
<font color="#696969">/* Both RED */</font>
<font color="#000000">PORTD<font color="#808030">=</font>B11001001<font color="#800080">;<br><br></font></font></pre>The <b>DDRD</b> sets the <i>direction</i> to all output except for the bit 6 and 7. The <b>PORTD</b> sets the beginning state. At first we choose to place both the semaphore to red on both sides.<br><br><br>To set this values we can double-click on the <i>Transition Line</i> opening the <i>Transition Editing Dialog Box</i> and place the code in <b>Action</b>.<br><br><img src="bb19.png" alt="" width="458" hspace="30" height="267" align="left"><br>
<div class="reference">
Since we have an initial state that is the constructor and cannot be interrupted or guarded, the only thing we can define here is the Transition Action to perform. <br><br>As previously said In a <b>Transition</b> we execute in this order :<br>
<ol><li><b>Exit Action</b> of the old state</li><li><b>Transition Action</b></li><li><b>Entry Action</b> of the new state</li></ol>
</div>
<br>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><div class="reference">
The 1 and 3 are related to the states, in this case the old state does
not exists as well as its actions.<br>
<br>
The Entry is defined int the <b>YCross</b>, if we define something
there it is always considered every time a transition is entering in
that state, while the <b>Transition</b> <i>Action</i> is strictly
related to the specific transition.<br><br><b>Note</b>:&nbsp; differently from the previous examples, a transition is not a
    <i>Standalone Object</i>, and it has a meaning only if used to connect
    something to something else. In this case by removing one of the two objects, a transition is
    automatically destroyed with his code.<b> </b>In the same way,<b> </b>a line position depends from the source and the
    destination, trying to move a line will create a fixed point. This
    point can be moved by clicking close to it, or you can create new
    point. To remove a fixed point after you selected it, you can press
    the <b>BackSpace</b> Key.<br>
    
</div>
<br><br><br><br><h3>A Time Transition</h3><br>As you know a real <b>Transition</b> <i>"shots</i>" when an event occurs.<br><br>The first real transition we meet in our <i>Semaphore</i> is a <i>Timed Transition</i>.<br><br>In this case, the event is the end of a time interval, starting from the moment the system enters in the current state.<br><br><div class="reference">
A <b>Time Transition</b> uses a <b>long</b> variable and the defined library function to get a time
reference, in a unsigned variable of some type (usually a 32 bit
variable unsigned long).<br>
<br>
The time difference is calculated considering the overflow through a <i>two
complement operation</i> on the signed type, the maximum time in case of 32
bits is 25 days .<br>
<br>
There is only one possible exiting time transition from one state if
this happens, all the transitions entering this state reset the variable
(like an entry action).<br>
<br>
Further consideration including the <i>Time Follower</i> problem, will
be detailed later.</div><br>Before placing the transition we need to find the next <b>State</b>
that
we will call <b>GDir</b> that means <b>G</b>reen on <b>D</b>irect and
<b>R</b>ed on <b>C</b>rossing&nbsp; :<br><br><table width="191" height="43" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top"><img src="bb9.png" alt="" width="52" hspace="30" height="32"></td><td valign="top"><b><img src="bb18.png" alt="" width="32" height="32" align="middle"></b></td><td valign="top"><img src="bb6.png" alt="" width="53" hspace="30" height="31"></td></tr></tbody></table><br>
and then the transition between the two states. <br><br><img src="bb20.png" alt="" width="250" hspace="100" height="64" align="left"><br><br><br><br><br>Now, the <i>Transition Editing Dialog Box</i> appears to be different.<br><br><img src="bb21.png" alt="" width="485" hspace="30" height="283" align="left"><br>We can choose <b>Time</b> as the <b>Event</b> in the higher box.<br><br>We have already defined the time for this transition as <b>timeYC</b> and we can put it into the <i>Timeout</i> field.<br>
    <br>The new code will switch on only the <b>G</b>reen <b>D</b> and the <b>R</b>ed <b>C </b>:<br><pre class="western"><font color="#696969">/* Bit X X GD YD RD GC YC RC */</font>
<font color="#000000">PORTD</font><font color="#808030">=</font><font color="#000000">B11100001</font><font color="#800080">;</font></pre><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br><br><br>
    <br>
    <br>
With this result :<img src="bb22.png" alt="" width="373" hspace="50" height="75" align="middle"><br>
    <br><br><br><br><h2>Completion of the machine</h2><br>
    As we can guess, we need two more states, <b>YDir</b> and <b>GCross</b> , to
    complete the full semaphore cycle and then three more <i>Timed Transition</i> :<br><br>
    from <b>GDir</b> to <b>YDir</b> waiting <b>timeGD</b> and executing:<br>
    
    <pre class="western"><font color="#696969">/* Bit X X GD YD RD GC YC RC */</font>
<font color="#000000">PORTD<font color="#808030">=</font>B11010001<font color="#800080">;</font></font></pre>
     <br>
    from <b>YDir </b>to <b>GCross</b> waiting <b>timeYD</b> and executing:<br>
    <pre class="western"><font color="#696969">/* Bit X X GD YD RD GC YC RC */</font>
<font color="#000000">PORTD<font color="#808030">=</font>B11001100<font color="#800080">;</font></font></pre>
    <br>
    and from <b>GCross</b> to <b>YCross</b>, waiting <b>timeGC</b> and executing:<br>
    
    <pre class="western"><font color="#696969">/* Bit X X GD YD RD GC YC RC */</font>
<font color="#000000">PORTD</font><font color="#808030">=</font><font color="#000000">B11001010</font><font color="#800080">;</font></pre><br>
    This is the self explanatory final drawing :<br><br><img src="bb23.png" alt="" width="530" hspace="50" height="304"><br>
    <br>At this point we can <b>Save </b>and then generate the code with :<br><br><img src="bb24.png" alt="" width="288" hspace="50" height="93"><br><br>
    <br>Good, we have already completed the first machine that is ready to be compiled and executed on the <i>Arduino</i> hardware.<br><br>Nevertheless, before doing this, we need another little setup of the developing environment, by adjusting and importing some file into the project folder.<br><br>
