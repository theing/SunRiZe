    <h1> Learning by Example</h1>
    <br>
    This document follows the “Learning by Example” rules. We will start
    with an example, trying to details everything, defining the default
    model and how does it run.<br>
    <br>
    Our example is based on the Arduino architecture and the related
    code editor.<br>
    <br>
    I opted for Arduino instead of a AT48, or a PIC24FJ128 because you
    have probably already heard of it, due to the fact that is an
    immediate platform, ready to be programmed everywhere with an USB,
    largely used for hobby and unprofessional works.<br>
    <br>
    Anyway if your micro supports at least a C-99 compliant compiler,
    this model should work like a charm. I used previous versions of <b>SunRize</b>
    to develop several professional works from 8 to a 32 bit CPU.<br>
    <br>
    <div class="reference"> The evidenced rows, represent the real
      reference documentation indicating the model structure and the
      tool usage. </div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2> Requirements</h2>
    <br>
    <b>SunRiZe</b> is a programmers tools, so this document uses a
    technical language.<br>
    <br>
    In order to read and understand this document, you should know at
    least:<br>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>The C language</li>
      <li>The basic rules of Micro Controllers programming and
        elementary hardware.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    If you know that, we can proceed.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h1> Building a traffic semaphore</h1>
    <h2> Arduino and SunRiZe</h2>
    As you probably know the Arduino 1 architecture is based on a AVR
    micro processor (ATmega328) with a specific PCB an a (strange) IDE.<br>
    <br>
    As we said, <b>SunRiZe</b> is not specifically designed for Arduino
    , it is designed to realize projects with a proper make file and a
    complete tool-chain, with multiple program files and compiled
    libraries.<br>
    <br>
    The simplified paradigm that <b>is not UML</b> is designed to
    produce <b>C</b> code and not <b>C++</b>, because it is expressly
    designed for small micro, when you don’t even have a dynamic memory
    manager and in this case, I found the C++ underused, heavy and
    unnecessarily complicated.<br>
    <br>
    If you don’t have an Arduino piece of hardware, I suggest you to
    make or buy one, after all is Open Hardware.<br>
    <br>
    <h2> A bit of bit</h2>
    For people who does not know exactly Arduino is made, on a side it
    has a classic 0.1 inches connector with 14 IO ports exposed.<br>
    <br>
    The first 8 ports, from 0 to 7 are connected to the PORTD , while
    the ports from 8 to 13, are connected to the first 6 bit (0-5) of
    the PORTB of an AVR cpu, usually ATmega328.<br>
    <br>
    At the moment we will use these 3 registers of <i>Arduino</i> :<br>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li><b>PORTD</b> output D</li>
      <li><b>PIND</b> input D</li>
      <li><b>DDRD</b> Data Direction Register D (1 output, 0 input)</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    We need to build a simplified semaphore, so we will connect six <b>LED</b>
    to the input port, Red, Yellow and Green. In order to mark the
    different directions, we will call them <b>D</b> (as direct) and <b>C</b>
    (as cross), the resulting connection to the <b>PORT D</b> follow
    this order :<br>

    <h2> Running SunRiZe</h2>
    <br>
    If you have a compiled version of <b>SunRiZe</b> you will probably
    have a folder with and executable, some library (if any) and a file
    named <b>GenCode.js</b> that is the <i>Javascript Code Generator</i>.<br>
    <br>
    The location of these file does not matter because <b>SunRiZe</b>
    will start everything from its folder.<br>
    <br>
    We need to create a folder project separately as previously
    indicated in Documents (where we do prefer). We are creating a
    traffic semaphore, so we can name the folder "<b>Semaphore</b>" with
    the subfolder <i>Arduino</i> and the links as previously indicated.<br>
    <br>
    Now we can click and run the <b>SunRiZe </b>executable :<br>
    <br>
    <img src="aa2.png" alt="" width="407" hspace="20" height="263"
      align="left">At first we can open the drop down menu “File” and
    then click Project :<br>
    <br>
    <img src="aa3.png" alt="" width="130" hspace="20" height="171"><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    The <i>folder choice dialog box</i> is opening and we can select
    the “<b>Semaphore</b>” folder we have previously created, accepting
    to create a new model inside.<br>
    <br>
    After selecting the project folder, we can Save the project and the
    file "<b>model.srz</b>" will be placed into it.<br>
    <br>
    The next time we select the folder the project will be loaded
    automatically.<br>
    <br>
    <div class="reference"><b>Reload</b> is used to restore the project
      to the last saved state, if
      we have done something wrong : this action will delete the current
      changes to the latest Save.<br>
    </div>
    <br>
    We are ready to design our first module now.<br>
